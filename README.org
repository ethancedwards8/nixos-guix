Guix - For NixOS
-----

Notes:
This project waws originally started by @yoctocell on GitHub
and later forked by @emiller88 and @bqv as they patched it in
various ways. I aim to (somewhat) maintain their work by fixing
any bugs I find, and provide a binary cache.

* Binary Cache

I found that it takes an extraordinary amount of time to build
this project, even on a fast machine. So I setup a GHA workflow
and a cachix cache to aid in this:

=cachix use ethancedwards8=

* Long term goal

Hopefully, I can upstream these various guile and guix packages
to nixpkgs and hopefully our own binary cache won't be necessary.
