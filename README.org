Guix - For NixOS
-----

Notes:
This project was originally started by @bqv on GitHub
and later forked by @emiller88 and then @yoctocell as they patched
and maintained it in various ways. We aim to (somewhat) maintain
their work by fixing any bugs that are found, and provide a binary cache.

* Binary Cache

We found that it takes an extraordinary amount of time to build
this project, even on a fast machine. So we setup a GHA workflow
and a cachix cache to aid in this:

=cachix use ethancedwards8=

* Long term goal

Hopefully, we can upstream these various guile and guix packages
to nixpkgs and then our own binary cache won't be necessary.
